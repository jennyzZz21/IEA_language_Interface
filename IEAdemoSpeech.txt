Hey, IEA, are you online?
How are you today?
Do you recognize me?
I am doing a presentation here and need a little bit help.
Great! Do you remember I ask you to watch the production line of MP66?
Did you observe any anomalies?
Yes, of course.
Can you read the first two results for me?
Ok, I understand. Did you find any relevant wafer patterns in those lots?
Can you explain why not?
Ok, wait a second. Let me take a look.
Ok, I see. but did you find any systematic pattern at all?
Ok, I see. By the way, did you look at the yield from the test bin perspective as well? 
Ok, that is good.
Did you perform any correlation analysis on the process parameters for test bin 24?
What do you mean without a high correlation coefficient?
Ok, I see. But did you find any other interesting trends with the process parameters?
Can you elaborate on these trends?
Ok, that is very interesting.
How did you find those trends?
Can you show me some examples of how I trained you?
Great. Is anything else you want to report at this point?
Ok, what is unusual about the testers?
That is great.
Can you send me a summary presentation based on our conversation?
No. That's all. Thank you for your help today.
